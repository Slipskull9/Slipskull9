Here's a current list of goals I'm working towards:
   * Nand2Tetris Part 1 :- almost complete, currently working on an assembler written in C.
   * Build a VPN tunnel into my home network.
   * SSH into a computer residing in another country and install a program.
   * Build a network from scratch using Cisco products.
   * Navigate doing everyday mundane tasks using only Powershell / Bash and learn scripting to automate repetitive tasks.


Here's what I've learnt so far:
   * Utilised HDL to build a 16-bit computer starting from Nand gates
   * Used 16-bit assembly to build very simple code for multiplying two numbers and turning the screen black when pressing a key on the keyboard.
   * Optimise a 2011 Toshiba Satellite to run Void linux (musl) and used it to build a Docker image and run a working instance of Pihole
   * Repair a corrupt BIOS on a laptop using Windows To Go

About me: I grew up in Grenada and studied a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in Tampa, Florida. I moved to the UK and currently work as a BIM Engineer and discovered my passion for I.T. through automating CAD designs using excel and iLogic.
